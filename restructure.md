# Restructure data

Using the Restructure data procedure to restructure data from multiple variables (columns) in a single case (row) to groups of related cases.

## Ways to restructure data

- wide to long
	- Select this option when all variables of a unique case appear in a single row (wide format), and you want to rearrange some variables into groups of related rows for each case (long format).

- long to wide
	- Select this option when multiple rows are present for each unique case in an active dataset (long format), and you want to rearrange related variables into a single row per case (wide format).

- Transpose all data
	- Select this option when you want to convert all rows (cases) to columns (variables) and all columns to rows. All rows become columns and all columns become rows in the new data. This option performs the same function as the Transpose feature.

A variable contains information that you want to analyze (for example, a measurement or a score). A case is an observation (for example, an individual). In a simple data structure, each variable is a single column in your data and each case is a single row. So, for example, if you were measuring test scores for all students in a class, all score values would appear in only one column, and there would be a row for each student.
